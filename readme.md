This is an [AIML 2.1](http://www.aiml.foundation/) and C# bot and associated [SRGS](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/) files for a chat bot that acts as a Defuser in the game [_Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_](https://keeptalkinggame.com/).
For more information, follow the links above.

See also the [Expert bot](https://github.com/AndrioCelos/BombExpert), which is compatible with pure AIML 2.0.

The bot recognises specific protocols for the Expert to use to tell it what to do. For more information, see the doc directory and output reply tags.
